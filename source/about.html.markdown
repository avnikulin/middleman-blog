Hi, I'm Alex. My interests are in software development, business, and finance.

This blog's mission is to shine a light on software development, business, and finance. I will periodically write about these topics and discuss my projects. I believe in a strong connection between the three topics and I will try to tie them together.

Everything on this site is free to use for personal and commericial use.
